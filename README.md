# Framer Modules
A Collection of reusable modules for Framer.js
For instructions on how to use modules, check the [docs](http://framerjs.com/docs/#modules.modules)

## Usage
Given we don't have private NPM, installing modules is a bit of a manual process.
Download the repo, look at the example, and then copy the appropriate files from the example's /modules folder to yours. 

## Modules
This repo contains the following modules

#### Ripple Button
Applies a ripple effect to any layer. You can customise the colour, element shadow, and timing.
TODO: Allow a ripple to be called manually, rather than just firing on tap
TODO: Allow the ripple to spawn from the tap point, rather than the center of the layer
